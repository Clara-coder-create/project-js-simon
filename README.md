# Simon

Let's build a single-player Simon game.

Watch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4> to see how the game works.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone the fork to your computer
1. Add any teammates as collaborators
1. Run `npm install` inside the project directory
1. Deploy to surge using `npm run publish`

The `site/` directory is where the HTML, CSS, and JS lives.

## Iterations

With a real Simon game, the machine plays a sequence of colors/sounds and the player has to repeat them in the same order. The game continues until the player makes a mistake. Their final score is the total number of turns it took.

It'll be your job to break down the work into iterations and divide the learning.

We've included the [jQuery][url-jquery] library, which can make it easier to react to user input.

You're free to use any libraries, tools, or technologies you think are appropriate. You can modify the files any way you want: edit them, add code to them, create more files, etc.

You can use `console.log` to see what your code is doing. It will be displayed in the debugging console, which you can activate by right-clicking the page, selecting *Inspect Element*, and then clicking the *Console* tab.

If you're using Chrome on a Mac, you can also open it with `Command + Option + j`.
